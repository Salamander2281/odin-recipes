    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>    
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>3 cups hot vegetable stock</li>                  
            <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>              
            <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>freshly ground white pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil and butter in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat until butter is melted. Reduce heat to medium-low and add shallot and garlic. cook and stir until shallots are translucent but not brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in rice and stir until the rice is coated in oil and has started to toast, about 5 minutes. Pour in wine and let it simmer until it has mostly evaporated, then stir in one-third of the boiling vegetable broth ; continue stirring until the rice has absorbed the liquid and turned creamy. Repeat this process twice more, stirring constantly. Stirring in the broth should take 15 to 20 minutes in all. When finished, the rice should be tender yet firm to the bite. You may not need all the vegetable stock.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese, parsley, salt, and white pepper until well combined. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
